        <h2>SALTED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES (SECRETLY VEGAN)</h2>
        <h3>YIELDS APPROXIMATELY 18 COOKIES</h3>
        <a href="https://oven.ly/blogs/recipes/salted-chocolate-chip"> Recipe from Ovenly Bakery</a>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p class="ingredients">
            2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour<br>
            
            1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
            
            3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br>
            
            1/2 teaspoon fine salt<br>
            
            1 1/4 cups dark chocolate chips (we prefer chocolate with 60% cocoa content or higher—double-check the ingredients if you want to make sure they're vegan)<br>
            
            1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar<br>
            
            1/2 cup (110 grams) packed light or dark brown sugar (note: on photo shoot day, we used an especially dark vegan brown sugar)<br>
            
            1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon canola, grapeseed, or any other neutral oil<br>
            
            1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water<br>
            
            Coarse-grained sea salt or flaky sea salt like Maldon, for garnish<br>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <p>
            In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the chocolate chips to the flour mixture and toss to coat.<br>
            
            In a separate large bowl, whisk the sugars briskly with the canola oil and water until smooth and incorporated, about 2 minutes. Note: Use fresh, soft light brown sugar. If there are clumps, break them up with the back of a spoon or your hand before whisking.<br>
            
            Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, and then stir with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until just combined and no flour is visible. Do not overmix.<br>
            
            Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Do not skip this step.<br>
            
            Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line two rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper. Remove dough from the refrigerator and use an ice cream scoop or a spoon to portion dough into 2-inch mounds. We recommend freezing the balls of dough for 10 minutes before baking as the cookies will retain their shape better while baking.<br>
            
            Sprinkle the balls of dough with coarse-grained sea salt (if freezing, remove balls of dough from the freezer first), and bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are just golden. Do not overbake.<br>
            
            Let cool completely before serving.<br>
