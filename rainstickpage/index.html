        <p> The digital rainstick is a piece I created for my final project in Interface Lab. 
            Inspired by a childhood rainstick toy while checking the weather forecast, 
            I wanted to recreate that experience digitally. 
            This project explores paradoxical technology, 
            highlighting how adding new functions to a device can complicate 
            its design and usability.
